# Flight-Price-Predictor
This Project uses Random Forest to predict the cost of Flights across  Multiple cities in India. 

This notebook highlights some of the MAJOR steps in machine learning such as:

        1. Importance of Exploratory Data Analysis
        2. Feature Engineering
        3. Feature Selection -#Important feature using ExtractTrees Regressor ---> Heps to find which features are important for the model.
        4. Hyper-Parameter Tuning
        5. Saving the Model for re-use in future Using Pickel.
        
 Some of the results of the process include:
